# 📊 Titanic Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster (1912) 
and visualizes the distribution of categorical and continuous variables 
using Python.

Dataset Used:
Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to:

- Visualize distribution of Gender (Categorical Variable)
- Visualize distribution of Age (Continuous Variable)
- Use Bar Chart and Histogram for representation

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains passenger details such as:

| Column | Description |
|--------|------------|
| PassengerId | Unique passenger ID |
| Survived | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| Pclass | Passenger class (1, 2, 3) |
| Name | Passenger name |
| Sex | Gender of passenger |
| Age | Age of passenger |
| Fare | Ticket fare |
